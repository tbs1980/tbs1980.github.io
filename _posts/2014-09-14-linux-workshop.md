In this post I collect the thoughts and ideas about the linux workshop I gave in UCL. This is for new PhD students and Post-docs who just started in UCL Astrophysics Group. Basically the students did a lot of examples after a few explanatory slides. I also gave them a cheat sheet of linux codes.


## Slides and exercises

The slides can be found the UCL Astrophysics [GitHub](https://github.com/Astrophysics-UCL/HPCInfo/blob/master/training/linux_hpc_workshop_oct_2014/slides/linux_hpc_workshop_oct_2014.pdf). It is all written in [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) with [beamer](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations). Here is the [source](https://github.com/Astrophysics-UCL/HPCInfo/blob/master/training/linux_hpc_workshop_oct_2014/slides/linux_hpc_workshop_oct_2014.tex).

Most of the students have some basic understanding of Linux/Unix. The cheatsheet was to give them a jump start. The exercises were from beginners level to intermediate. The solutions to exercises are [here](https://github.com/Astrophysics-UCL/HPCInfo/blob/master/training/linux_hpc_workshop_oct_2014/exercises/solutions.md).

I also gave a brief idea about the HPC facilities in the department and briefly mentioned best practices. Next year I plan to do a separate session on HPC.
