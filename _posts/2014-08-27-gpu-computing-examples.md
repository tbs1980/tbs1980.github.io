The best way to learn GPU based parallel programming is to actually code examples. Here I collect GPU based examples.

## Books I found useful

## Examples

I started adding the examples to a repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/tbs1980/GpuCompute). For each example I clearly indicated where the original source came from and what license it is distributed under.
