Splines are extremely useful to represent data when the underlying model is unknown or expensive to compute. I use them as a part of my cosmological calculations. In this post I explore the publicly available codes for computing splines. Here is an example of a noisy sine curve in [0,4pi] and smoothed spline curve obtained with GSL B-splines.

## Gnu Scientific Library (GSL)

[GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) offer B-splines as a part of the library. In c/c++ we can use the functionality by

{% highlight c %}
#include <gsl/gsl_bspline.h>
{% endhighlight %}

An example program can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Example-programs-for-B_002dsplines.html#Example-programs-for-B_002dsplines)

## Eigen library

[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is known for its excellence in linear algebra. It also offers a large set of unsupported modules. [Splines](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/unsupported/group__Splines__Module.html) is one of them. Below you can find a simple code I found in [KDE forum]()

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <unsupported/Eigen/Splines>

typedef Spline<double,2> Spline2d;
typedef Spline2d::PointType PointType;
typedef Spline2d::KnotVectorType KnotVectorType;
typedef Spline2d::ControlPointVectorType ControlPointVectorType;

ControlPointVectorType points = ControlPointVectorType::Random(2,100);
const Spline2d spline = SplineFitting<Spline2d>::Interpolate(points,3);

KnotVectorType chord_lengths; // knot parameters
Eigen::ChordLengths(points, chord_lengths);

for (Eigen::DenseIndex i=0; i<points.cols(); ++i)
{
    PointType pt = spline( chord_lengths(i) );
    PointType ref = points.col(i);
    VERIFY( (pt - ref).matrix().norm() < 1e-14 );
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Einspline library

[Einspline](http://einspline.sourceforge.net/) library offers excellent spline fitting facilities. There are several bases available, for example, linear, logarithmic and general. The code is written in c and runs fast. We can get the 1-D splines by including

{% highlight c %}
#include <nubspline.h>
{% endhighlight %}

## Benchmarking splines

I needed to see how each of these libraries compare to each other and decided to code up a benchmarking repository in github. It can be found [here](https://github.com/tbs1980/SplineBenchmarks)
