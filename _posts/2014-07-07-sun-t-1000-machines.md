Recently I got hold of 2 Sun T-1000 machines off ebay! It was my first "contact" with a server. I mean, the only way to connect with this server is through a serial terminal. Facinating! The specs of this machine are really impressive. It has an 8 core Sun Ultra Spark III processor. These are actually not floating point units, but rather integer units. Hence the floating point performance is will not really scale as we would think. Installing Debian on this is a very challenging task and it took a full of work (baisally a weekend) to get this installed. Here are the steps I took in the marathon process.

## Overview

The server looks like below

I found some documents about the machine.

2. [Server Overview](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19076-01/t1k.srvr/819-3245-12/819-3245-12.pdf)
3. [Service Manual](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19076-01/t1k.srvr/819-3248-13/819-3248-13.pdf)
4. [Server System Admin Guide](http://www.sunhelp.org/docs/t1000/sysadmin-guide.pdf)

## Firing up

I connected the machine to my router through Network Management Port (NMP). It I can see that it has been assigned a ip-address. Now I can ssh into the machine's firmware. Default admin username is admin and password is "password" I think. At least it worked for me. When I type help in the sc prompt, I get the following result.

    sc> poweron -c

It gave me a warning message

    Enter 'help command-name' or 'help category-name' for more help
    (Use ONLY the first word of a category description)
    Examples:  help select   -or-   help line
        Main categories are:
    Breakpoints (debugging)
    Repeated loops
    Defining new commands
    Numeric output
    Radix (number base conversions)
    Arithmetic
    Memory access

    nvramrc (making new commands permanent)

`printenv` command will give all the environment variables. What we need to setup the netboot is `netowork-boot-arguments`.

    ok# setenv network-boot-arguments host-ip=192.168.0.20,subnet-mask=255.255.255.0,file=tftp://192.168.0.11/debiansparcboot.img


where host-ip is the ip-address of the sun-machine (the current one) the tftp address is the address of the machine where the tftp server is hosted. It is followed by the name of the boot image. More documentation can be found at
