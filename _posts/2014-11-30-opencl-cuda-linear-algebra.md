The linear algebra war is heating up! There are a handful of excellent linear algebra libraries with GPU backend and it exciting to see the different APIs and their capabilities.  

## Linear algebra libraries

First of all there are several excellent libraries for doing linear algebra in GPUs

1. [cuBlas](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuBLAS)
2. [clBlas](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS)
3. [Magma](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/overview/index.html)
4. [Vienna-CL](http://viennacl.sourceforge.net/index.html)

I haven't seen a performance comparison of these libraries yet.

## Other vector libraries

Some other important vector libraries are below

1. [BoostCompute](http://boostorg.github.io/compute/)
2. [Thrust](http://thrust.github.io/)
3. [Hsa-Bolt](https://github.com/HSA-Libraries/Bolt)
4. [ArrayFire](http://arrayfire.com/)
