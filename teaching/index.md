## Workshops on quantitative methods at Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, August 2015

[Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership](http://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/) runs an Masters in Sustainability Leadership. I did two workshops on quantitative method. One was an introductory workshop on "Quantitative Methods for Surveys" and the second was an "Advanced Quantitative methods clinic". Here are the slides and examples for these workshops in [GitHub](https://github.com/tbs1980/CISLQuantWorkshop).

## Linux/HPC introductory workshop at UCL Astrophysics Group, October 2014

I did 90 minutes workshop for the new PhD students and Post-docs. There were two volunteers to help me. About 20 people attended the course. The slides and exercises can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Astrophysics-UCL/HPCInfo/tree/master/training)
