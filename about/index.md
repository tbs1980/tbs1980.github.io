I am a member of the Astronomy and Astrophysics group in [University College London](www.ucl.ac.uk).

## Short introduction

I am interested in the application of emerging technologies in science and in science for creating exciting new technologies. I am fascinated by the emerging computing platforms (GPU, FPGA) and frameworks (CUDA, OpenCL) and their application in accelerating scientific development. Conversely I have a keen interest in the development of novel algorithms and their applications in creating new technologies.

In UCL I work closely with [Dr. Filipe Abdalla](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star/people/fabdalla.html) and [Prof. Ofer Lahav](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star/people/olahav.html) on a variety of topics in Large Scale Structure surveys. I co-manage and support the [High Performance Computing Cluster in the group](https://github.com/Astrophysics-UCL/HPCInfo). I am a member of the steering committee of the [UCL Research Programming Hub](http://research-programming.ucl.ac.uk/). I manage the [code-repository](https://github.com/Euclid-OULE3) for the data analysis of the [EUCLID](http://www.euclid-ec.org/) satellite data.

I did my PhD in the [Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory](http://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/),  University of Cambridge with [Prof. Michael Hobson](http://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/prof-mike-hobson) and [Dr. Mark Ashdown](http://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-mark-a-j-ashdown). My thesis was on Bayesian Methods for Astrophysical Data Analysis. Prior to that I did my MSc. in Physics at UCL.

I have a significant interest in the numerical methods and their implementation. I actively participate in [Eigen C++ community](https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/pull-requests/109/numerical-integration-module-for-eigen) and the [London High Performance Computing Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/UK-Higher-Performance-Computing/).

## My Research Interests:

* Bayesian inference
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
* Large Scale Structure of the Universe
* Cosmic Microwave Background
* High Performance Computing
* Parallel computing technologies
* Software development in academia
