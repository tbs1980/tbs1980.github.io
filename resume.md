### INTRO
```I'm Sreekumar, a data scientist and AI researcher with expertise in Bayesian inference, time series modeling, and machine learning. I’ve led data science teams, co-founded an AI-driven startup, and worked on astrophysical research that led to the discovery of extra-solar planets. My work spans startups, academia, and real-world AI applications.```  


### EXPERIENCE

##### Head of Data Science - **Proportunity** <span style="float: right; ">2022-2024</span>  
Joined the company at the seed stage as the 5th employee and grew the data science team to 5 scientists and engineers. Led the design and development of a Machine Learning (ML) model ensemble; achieved industry-leading accuracy of 93%. Worked closely with the product team to deploy the company's data-driven real estate market intelligence platform incorporating six datasets,  resulting in approximately 20% improvement in the website visitors using the platform.

 
##### Co-founder & CTO - **Alpha-I** <span style="float: right; ">2016-2018</span>  
Co-founded an AI powered hedge fund and spearheaded the development of a Bayesian Deep Learning model for trading S&P-500 stocks; raised close to $1 million in seed funding through Entrepreneur First and other global VCs. 

##### Postdoctoral Research Associate - **University College London** <span style="float: right; ">2012-2016</span>  
Researched and developed cutting-edge Bayesian statistical methods with High Performance Computing (HPC) for analysing cosmological data from space telescopes; 20 peer reviewed publications.

### EDUCATION

##### University of Cambridge, UK <span style="float: right; ">2008-2012</span>  
**Doctor of Philosophy in Astrophysics**  
Developed highly efficient Bayesian Statistical methods for astrophysical and cosmological data analysis, resulting in the co-discovery of 3 new extra solar planets. 
 
##### University College London, UK <span style="float: right; ">2006-2007</span>  
**Master of Science in Physics**  
Researched and developed a novel Bayesian technique for detecting extra-solar planets and estimating their orbital parameters, resulting in the publication of the Masters thesis as an article in the prestigious Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal.

##### National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India <span style="float: right; ">1998-2002</span>  
**Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering**
